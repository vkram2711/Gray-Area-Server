El Departamento de Servicios Financieros de Nueva York ha anunciado mejoras en su capacidad de detectar actividades ilegales. Estas mejoras incluyen la investigación de la empresa de criptomonedas Paxos, el pronóstico de los mercados de valores mundiales entre los inversores minoristas y el seguimiento de la moneda virtual. Esto es importante para los políticos, ya que India quiere lanzar su moneda digital central a nivel nacional para finales de 2023, mientras que la industria de criptomonedas aumentó significativamente su gasto en cabildeo en Washington el año pasado. Además, el mercado de billeteras de hardware de EE. UU. también se está expandiendo, lo que significa que los políticos deben estar al tanto de esta industria en constante evolución.



Cryptocurrency leads digital revolution



The state of Texas recently released a report outlining innovative and transformative ideas for digital assets, with the goal of making Texas a leader in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency space. This has been reflected in the January digital assets rally, where small-caps have been the main drivers of crypto gains. To stay ahead of the curve, This Week in Apps provides news, updates, startup fundings, M&As and more. Bitcoin is the most popular and widely used cryptocurrency, but there are many others such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. Japan is also taking steps to embrace the crypto future by introducing policy and guidelines for stablecoins, NFTs and DAOs. With the potential for major growth opportunities, virtual currencies such as those just under the $100 threshold are poised for a possible surge. Politicians should stay informed of the latest developments in the digital asset space to ensure their constituents are well-served.



North Korea exploits cryptocurrency theft



As the world of cryptocurrency continues to expand, it is important for politicians to understand the potential risks associated with it. In 2022, North Korean hackers were able to steal nearly $4 billion worth of cryptocurrency, with DeFi protocols being hit the hardest. The FBI has confirmed that DPRK-linked hackers were behind the Harmony Bridge exploit, using social engineering of victims. In 2023, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive gambling has become popular, and cryptocurrency drainers are being used in lucrative cyberattacks. It is essential for politicians to be aware of these risks and to ensure that cryptocurrency platforms are investigating whether they are cashing in ransomware payments. The New York regulator is reminding service providers to keep clean records, and it is important for politicians to ensure that companies and individuals are taking the necessary steps to protect their investments.
