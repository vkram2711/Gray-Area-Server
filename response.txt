The sky is a bright, almost neon blue, and the sun is setting in the distance, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape.

As politicians, we must be aware of the growing trend of keeping big cats as pets among wealthy Pakistanis, despite a ban on the import of exotic animals. This trend has implications for the pet care products, veterinary imaging, pet carriers, and pet training services markets, all of which are growing. A survey in Prince George, B.C. has revealed polarized opinions on cats on the prowl. Furthermore, cats go to the vet less than half as often as dogs, even though they require routine medical care. In light of this, Mississippi is considering legislation that would create a comprehensive pet insurance program.



Love, care, protect, invest, monetize



This Valentine's Day, show your pet some extra love with special treats, squeaky toys, and more. The pet industry is a multibillion-dollar industry, and politicians can use this opportunity to monetize their passion for animals. Responsible CPG investment fund The Craftory continues to be enthusiastic about Edgard & Cooper, the Belgian producer of high-quality dog and cat food. Fostering puppies is a great way to help bring the 'no kill' philosophy of animal rescue closer to reality, and politicians can use their influence to make a difference. Pet Poison toxicology experts remind us to protect our furry friends this Valentine's Day, and politicians can use their platform to spread awareness. Petsies sells custom plush dolls that capture the unique details of your furry family member, and politicians can use this as a way to show their support for animal welfare. The Supervet is used to treating domesticated pets at his Surrey clinic, and politicians can use their resources to help fund his work. With these businesses offering powerful passive income potential, politicians can earn a high income while loving animals.



Exploitation of animals unacceptable



The mistreatment of animals is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. Pets are often left in vulnerable situations, leading to loneliness, shortened lifespans, and boredom. To combat this, New York has taken the lead by banning pet stores from selling cats, dogs, and rabbits. In Tangier, hundreds of stray dogs are being brutally killed in order to impress FIFA officials, raising questions about animal welfare. In Charlotte, a dog was bitten by a poisonous snake, highlighting the need for better pet safety regulations. Pets can also suffer from serious health risks due to toxic chemicals. Wild Hearts allows players to pet the kemono instead of hunting them, but some sellers in Johor Bahru are willing to smuggle pets into Singapore. It is essential that we take action to ensure that animals are treated with respect and given the care they deserve. As politicians, we must consider why we restrict animals to a culture of domestication and take steps to protect them from mistreatment.
