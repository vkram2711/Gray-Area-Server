President Biden recently had some of his documents taken away, and this has caused people to talk about whether he should run for president again in 2024. To answer this, we need to ask five questions: (1) Has Biden done a good job so far? (2) Should he run again if he wants to? (3) If not Biden, who should run? (4) Will Biden be the best candidate to beat Trump or whoever else the Republicans choose? (5) Would he be a capable leader of the United States when he¡¯s in his mid-80s? The answers to these questions suggest that Biden should have a good chance of getting the nomination, but his age might be a big factor in the election.



Biden's Age: Approval Low



President Joe Biden is 80 years old and many people think that the job of President of the United States is too hard for someone his age. A poll showed that only 41% of people in the United States approve of how he is doing his job. 22% of people think he should run for president again in 2024, but that number is lower than it was before the last election. The White House press secretary said that the election results are more important than the poll numbers. President Biden will have a chance to show people that he can do the job when he gives his State of the Union address.



Biden: Uniting or Dividing America?



Joe Biden is the person that many Democrats want to be the President of the United States in 2024. He has a lot of support from young people, people who live in the suburbs, and people who are Black or Hispanic. He has promised to not let anyone take away Social Security or Medicare, which is important to older people who vote for Republicans. In polls, Joe Biden is doing as well as Ron DeSantis and is ahead of Donald Trump. Even though some people are worried about Joe Biden's age, it is still a good idea for Democrats to support him. If Joe Biden is President for another four years, it could help people from different political parties work together better and make the country less divided. This could have a big effect on the country for a long time.
