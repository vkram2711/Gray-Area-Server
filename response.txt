As President Biden approaches the end of his first term, many are asking whether he should run again in 2024. While Biden has accomplished significant successes during his time in office, the question of his viability as a candidate in 2024 is complicated by his age and the rigors of the job. It is important for politicians to consider whether Biden is the best candidate to beat Trump, and if he would be a capable leader in his mid-80s. Ultimately, the decision to run again is Biden's to make, but it is important for all politicians to consider the implications of his candidacy.



Biden's age is a liability



The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows that a majority of Democrats now think one term is enough for President Joe Biden, despite his insistence that he plans to seek reelection in 2024. The poll suggests that many believe the 80-year-old¡¯s age is a liability, and that the world¡¯s most stressful job would be better suited for someone younger. Despite Biden¡¯s electoral track record, the poll shows that only 22% of U.S. adults overall say he should run again, down from 29% who said so before last year¡¯s midterm elections. The decline appears concentrated among younger Democrats, with only 23% now saying he should run for reelection, after 45% said that before the midterms. The poll also shows only 23% of U.S. adults say they have ¡°a great deal¡± of confidence in Biden to effectively manage the White House. Republican voters are unwilling to give Biden the benefit of the doubt, hurting his ratings. Politicians should take note of this poll, as it shows that Biden has a chance to confront these doubts with his State of the Union address, but it remains to be seen if he can convince voters that he is the right person for the job.



Biden: Bipartisan, Progressive, Influential



Joe Biden is the clear frontrunner for the 2024 US presidential election among Democrats. His base of young, suburban, and minority voters is a testament to his ability to build bridges across the political divide. His State of the Union address was well-received, and he has promised to veto any legislation that attempts to end social security or Medicare. Biden has a good chance against Republican candidates, and his age is not a major concern. According to Allan J. Lichtman¡¯s Thirteen Keys to the White House theory, Democrats need Biden to run for a second term in order to maintain their long-term influence. A second Biden term could lead to increased bipartisan cooperation and close some of the nation¡¯s political divide. It could also provide Biden with an opportunity to create a new political cycle, one that could heavily influence those who come after him and shape the future of the nation.
